Enhancement Proposals
=====================

Description
===========

A ``predictably`` enhancement proposal (PREP) is a software design document
providing information to the ``predictably`` community.
The proposal should provide a rationale and concise technical specification of
the proposed design.

We intend PREPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing major changes,
for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design
decisions that have gone into ``predictably``.

Smaller changes will be discussed and implemented directly on issues and pull requests.

Existing PREPs
==============

You can find existing PREPs in the `enhancement_proposals folder`_ in the
package's root directory.

.. _enhancement_proposals folder: https://github.com/predict-ably/predictably/tree/main/enhancement_proposals

Submitting a PREP
=================

To create a new PREP, please copy and use sktime's `template`_ (update any
references to sktime when drafting your PREP) and open a pull request on
the ``predctably`` repository.

.. _template: https://github.com/sktime/enhancement-proposals/blob/main/TEMPLATE.md

It is highly recommended that a single PREP contains a single key proposal or new idea.
The more focused the proposal, the more successful it tends to be.
If in doubt, split your PREP into several well-focused ones.

A PREP should be a consolidated document, including:

* a concise problem statement,
* a clear description of the proposed solution,
* a comparison with alternative solutions.

Mission
=======

``predictably_core``'s goal is to make it easier for end users from a vareity
of backgrounds to reuse `scikit-learn`_ and `sktime`_ style design patterns in
their own projects.

Therefore, ``predictably_core`` includes functionality to help make the creation of
packages following these design patterns *predictable*.

Check out our :ref:`roadmap` for more details on how we plan achieve our mission.

.. _history:

History
=======

``predictably_core`` was started in 2024 by Ryan Kuhns.

The project builds on and was heavily inspired by Ryan's work on `skbase`_ with
Franz Kiraly. In turn, the `skbase`_ project drew its inspiration from
the Python interfaces used by `scikit-learn`_ (particularly the `BaseEstimator API`_)
and `sktime`_.

Development is supported by the project's steering committee, core developers
and the broader community (see `contributors <contributors.md>`_).
